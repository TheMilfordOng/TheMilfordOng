### Hi this is Milford here.

I'm just starting this programming thing to keep me away from my screwed up household, now I'm just stuck needing a new project as I have no idea what to build that I can improve my life.
I'll just keep on truding along the syntax until I can find a problem to solve that relates to my screwed up househole
I hope I can use this programming thing to automate and make my home life easier without having to deal with an alcoholic dad if I can even do it
